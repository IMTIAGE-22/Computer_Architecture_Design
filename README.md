Hi there! I'm excited to share my recent work in digital design and circuit simulation, where I’ve created detailed designs for various components and simulated their functionality. This project showcases my skills in digital logic design, circuit simulation, and technical documentation.

Project Overview: This portfolio includes a collection of designs for fundamental digital components, created using digital design software and saved as PNG files. Additionally, I’ve included video simulations to demonstrate the functionality of key circuits in action.

Designs Includes: 1-Bit Register, 3-Bit Register, 3-Bit Register Set, 3-Bit ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit), 3-Bit Adder, 3-Bit CPU (Initial and Final Designs), 3-Bit OR Gate, 3-Bit ROL (Rotate Left) Circuit, 4-Bit PC (Program Counter), 4-Bit Adder, 1x1 SRAM, 1x15 SRAM, 9x15 SRAM (Static Random-Access Memory Designs)

I’ve also created video simulations to demonstrate the functionality of the following circuits: ALU Circuit Simulation, Register Set Circuit Simulation, SRAM_Circuit_Simulation, Final_CPU_Simulation These simulations provide a clear view of how the circuits operate, showcasing their behavior in real-time.

Tools & Skills: Digital Design Software: Used to create precise and detailed circuit diagrams. Circuit Simulation: Leveraged to test and visualize the functionality of the designs. Technical Documentation: Organized and presented the designs in a clear, professional manner.

Why This Matters? This project highlights my ability to design, simulate, and document digital circuits, which are foundational to computer engineering and hardware development. It reflects my attention to detail, problem-solving skills, and passion for technology.I’d love to connect and discuss how my skills in digital design and simulation can contribute to your projects!
